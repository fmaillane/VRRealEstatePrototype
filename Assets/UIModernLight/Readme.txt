NOTE: 
The Demoscene.cs script creates all UI elements dynamically in the scene.
It is attached to the Canvas element and will be invokded automatically when you run the Demo scene. 
So, don't be surprised that the demo scene appears empty!                                          

While the scene is running you can inspect the created elements in the Hierarchy view.

You can also create UI elements manually by dragging the prefabs into the Hierarchy view.
                           
All prefabs are intended to be used with the automatic layout system in uGui.

The folder Assets/UIModernLight/Sources contains all source .psd files for the sprites
and an Illustrator .ai file for the radial scale.

I disabled mip maps in the sprite inspector for a number of sprites, because they showed rendering errors in the Web Player.
I suggest you test this with your particular installation.

The folder Assets/UIModernLight/Illustrator contains RadialScale.jsx script for creating customized radial scales in Illustrator.
